# DuckHuntCss

First I wanted a project to play with css3 animations, and then I needed something to learn jade and sass, so I decided to recreate one of the greatest game of my childhood: Duck hunt!
But what differ from all the other duck hunt on the internet is that this one does not have any javascript line, 100% css!
